## About Me ##
My name is Rachalle Way and I'm a recent graduate from the Univeristy of Florida with a Bachelor's of Science in Advertising. I am passionate about graphic design and I'm so excited to learn more about web design and apply that passion to web development. I currently live in Melbourne, FL about 30 minutes from the Kennedy Space Center. I work part-time as a graphic design assistant at a small digital marketing agency, but I'm trying to slowly transition into working as a freelance designer with a focus on illustration and branding projects. When I'm not studying or designing, you can find me working on a DIY project, at the movie theater watching the latest flick, trying new restaurants, thrifting, or binging the newest buzz-worthy show.

## Past Coding Experience ##
I have minor past coding experience that I gained during my first semester at UF. I don't remember the name of the course, but I believed it was for an extra credit project where we had to create a web page on a travel guide for our chosen location. I worked with HTML and CSS to create my own website from a web-based coding service. It was very minor and basic work, but I remember really enjoying it and taking great pride in the end result. I'm excited to develop on that knowledge through this course. 

## Career Goals ##
1. Become a full-time graphic designer, web designer, or product designer at a marketing or design agency
2. Work as a freelance designer on the side, focusing on illustration and branding
3. Ultimately transition into a role as a creative director at an advertising agency or brand
